## About The Project

### Database Schema

<br>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/i2OuCNm.png" alt="database schema" width="80%">

<br>
<br>

## Overview

This API was built using express to setup a nodejs server and interacts with a postgreSQL server using the ORM Sequelize to query and update the database. The app can support the current specifications of updating and creating a "creditor data model", but the way I've internally modeled the app allows the ability to extend the functionality to report information about debtors, or a "debtor data model".

## - creditors table

  The creditors table represents a bank or institution that lends out money

## - debtors table

  The debtors table represents a debtor that accepts money from a creditor

## - creditor_debtor (join/through table)

  The creditor_debtor table represents a many to many relationship between creditors giving out loans to one or multiple debtors and debtors accepting loans from one or multiple creditors. The balance and minimum payment percentage of each 'loan' is represented here because each creditor needs a record of the balance and minimum payment percentage between each of their debtors.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started

You will need npm installed on your machine to install dependencies for this project. You will also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [postgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed.

<br>

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

<br>

### Installation

<br>

To get the project running locally, follow these steps

<br>

1. Clone the repo onto your local machine

  ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/michael-gann/nodejs-sfs
  ```

  <br>

2. Install dependencies for the app

  ```sh
    npm install
  ```

  <br>

3. Create a local database using postgres and a user who owns it

  ```sql
    CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD <password>;
    CREATE DATABASE <database> WITH OWNER <username>;
  ```

  <br>

4. create a .env file and populate it with the values that were created above

  ```js
    DB_URL="postgres://username:password@localhost/database"
  ```

  <br>

5. start the application

  ```sh
    npm start
  ```

  <br>

## Serverless Setup

We're going to use [serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) to setup an AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda. Basically, we're going to wrap our express app with the serverless framework which will allow serverless to deploy our express app as a lambda function. That way anytime someone navigates to one of our defined API routes, our express app will handle the routing and we'll still reap the benefits of being serverless.

You will need an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account. I use Amazon RDS to create an aurora postgreSQL database to persist our data. We will also need to provide the ID's of any security groups or subnets we use in our serverless.yml file in order for serverless to know how to configure the API Gateway.

1. Create an AWS account or login to the management console if you have an account.

2. At the top of the page, search for RDS, and from here find and click on the "Create Database" button. Here we're going to create a PostgreSQL database. I used most of the default settings here but feel free to change the settings to your liking. The important information we need here is the database password. Make sure you keep track of it. You'll also need to make sure you click on "Additional configuration" and specify an initial database name, otherwise your database will not be created. It also might be a good idea to allow connections from outside your VPC so you can connect to the database on your local machine.

3. Now that our database is created (It will take a couple minutes) head over to the "serverless.example.yml" and change the name to "serverless.yml". In here we're going to need to insert the values needed for serverless to setup our lambda function. Go ahead and use the values you got from setting up your PostgreSQL production database and your development database locally.
<br>
(You'll need to navigate to AWS [RDS](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home), click "Databases" on the left side menu and then click on the link for your unique database instance that you created for this API. On this page, your host is the 'endpoint' listed under the "Connectivity & Security tab)

  ```yml
  custom:
    env:
      production:
        stage: production
        db_dialect: "postgres"
        db_url: <PRODUCTION DATABASE URL>
      development:
        stage: development
        db_dialect: "postgres"
        db_url: <LOCAL DATABASE URL>
  ```

4. Just next to where you grabbed your endpoint, we'll be grabbing the subnets and VPC's we setup for our database. Go ahead and copy those values into your serverless.yml file, in this section of the file. They should look something like the values in the example, either starting with 'sg' or 'subnet'.
<br>

  ```yml
  provider:
    name: aws
  runtime: nodejs14.x
  vpc:
    securityGroupIds:
      - <sg-id>
    subnetIds:
      - <subnet-id>
  region: <REGION>
  ```

5. Before we get further, we should probably make sure our local database has some valid data in it before we try to query for any data. In your terminal, navigate to the root of the API. Run these commands to run our sequelize migrations and seed files.

  ```sh
  npx dotenv sequelize db:migrate
  npx dotenv sequelize db:seed:all
  ```

6. Now that that's done, we're almost ready! Before we deploy to AWS, let's test our serverless functionality locally.

  ```sh
  sls offline --stage development
  ```

7. You should see something like this

  ```sh
   ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │                                                                       │
   │   ANY | http://localhost:3000/development                             │
   │   POST | http://localhost:3000/2015-03-31/functions/app/invocations   │
   │   ANY | http://localhost:3000/development/{proxy*}                    │
   │   POST | http://localhost:3000/2015-03-31/functions/app/invocations   │
   │                                                                       │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  ```
7. Go ahead and navigate to that first link and append "/api/creditor" to see if we get any data. If we do, congratulations! Our API seems to work!

8. Now let's go ahead and run our migrations on our AWS PostgreSQL database. We have a plugin for serverless that will let us do that. Go ahead and run this command.

  ```sh
  sls migrations up --path "./db/migrations" --stage production
  ```

9. And since there's no plugin for running seed files, we'll use this command.

  ```sh
  npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all --url 'postgresql://<PRODUCTION DATABASE_URL>'

  ```

8. Now that we're feeling confident, let's go ahead and push our version of the API to AWS. We'll do that with this command.

  ```sh
  sls deploy --stage production
  ```

9. This will create a .serverless file in the root of your API and serverless will take care of forming our AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda. It might take a couple minutes the first time we deploy since it has to build the postgres layer.

10. Once the command is finished running it should say if it was successful or not. If it was successful, you should see this.

  ```sh
  Serverless: Stack update finished...
  Service Information
  service: nodejs-sfs
  stage: production
  region: us-east-2
  stack: nodejs-sfs-production
  resources: 13
  api keys:
    None
  endpoints:
    ANY - https://--------.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/production
    ANY - https://--------.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/production/{proxy+}

    app: nodejs-sfs-production-app
  layers:
    pg: arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:------------:layer:pg:2
  Serverless: Removing old service artifacts from S3...
  ```

11. Navigate to the first endpoint provided and append "/api/creditor/". If we get back some data, congratulations! Our app is now deployed as an AWS Lambda. We're now serverless. Read on below for detailed information about using this API.



<!-- ### Prerequisites

 -->

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
# Usage

Once you have the app running on localhost, you will be able to start making requests to the API on localhost. If you followed the steps above you can use the url for the serverless version of this API, but the examples will use localhost.

## Routes

- [GET, POST, PATCH] "/api/creditor/"
- [GET] "/api/creditor/:institution
- [GET] "/api/creditor/analysis"

### GET /api/creditor/

  This endpoint will return a list of all creditor data models

  ```js
  [
    {
      "id": number,
      "creditorName": string,
      "firstName": string,
      "lastName": string,
      "minPaymentPercentage": number,
      "balance": number
    }
  ]
  ```

### POST /api/creditor/

  This endpoint will allow you to create a new creditor data model. You must provide a first and last name, an institution name, and a balance and minimum payment percentage in the body of the request like so

  ```js
